# Pie Charts

Some Practice with MatPlotLib Pie Charts. 

## Graph

The Pie Graph is a visualization of the coding languages used in a given directory. A list of programming languages and their extensions is parsed from a (Wikipedia Article)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages]. A `.json` file with this Data is created in the `Data` directory and is used to identify the languages used. Comments are included when scanning files, so the results may look different than those on Github. To generate a Pie Chart for any directory, copy it into this folder and run the script.

As an example, here is the Pie Chart for my [UW-Course-Tool](https://github.com/AlexEidt/UW-Course-Tool) repository.

Script: `code.py`
